# Computational Physics (PHY407)

This repository contains my assignments and lab reports for **PHY407 – Computational Physics** at the University of Toronto.  
The course teaches numerical methods through physics-oriented problems. We implement algorithms in Python using `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib`, and analyze their accuracy, efficiency, and stability.

## Highlights
- Explored numerical precision and error propagation.  
- Implemented Gaussian quadrature for integrals.  
- Applied Fourier transforms to signal analysis.  
- Solved PDEs (heat and Burgers’) with finite difference schemes.  

## Usage
Clone the repo and run any script:
```bash
python A2/Lab2_Q1.py
```

Most labs also include a PDF report (`Report_Tabja.pdf`) with analysis.
